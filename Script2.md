# Backstory

A peaceful world has turned into chaos in recent years.
A dark force has summoned hordes of monsters into the once peaceful meadows and woods of Tangea. 
Even some of the citizens of the Oak kingdom are turning into terrible abominations. 
Nobody is sure why these calamities are occuring in a part of the world where conflict was once rare. 
Nobody but one.

Kira has been living in Oak town ever since she was little. 
Taken in as an orphan by the local weapon shop owner, she has grown to love the kind people of her village. 
Even in the midst of all the recent calamities these villagers never lost their warmth 
and they continued to live as best they could. 

This year, Kira turned 18 years old. When she woke up on the morning of her birthday, 
a flood of terrible memories came back to her. The truth of why she became an orphan and 
the origin of all the calamities of this world. She was created by the dark lord Malkior, 
a shadowy being with terrible power. He had intended Kira to be like all of the horrors he 
had set into this world, but in his rush, he created a kind young girl that didnt have an ounce of malice in her heart. 
She was found in the woods by the armor seller of Oak town who later took her back to his village and adopted her. 

The girl had no memory of her origin and grew up like a regular child. 
The sudden realization of her origin filled her with horror and determination. 
She knew she had to defeat this dark lord who is behind the evil in this world. 
So she asks his adoptive father for a sword and sets out into the world to train herself 
and ultimately put an end to Malkior. 

Even though she is the only one who seems to know anything about the dark lord, 
she doesnt know much. This is why she has to somehow find out more. 
One of these things unknown to Kira is that if Malkiro should fall, 
all his creations will die alongside him…

# Locations

Oak town is a small medieval village/town surrounded by expansive stretches of grassland. 
Beyond the meadows, there is the forest of Deepwood. Once a peaceful forest, 
it has become a very dangerous place, thanks to the hordes of the dark lord. 
The thickness of the woods blocks a lot of the sunlight from reaching the ground below, 
making Deepwood as gloomy as it is perilous. The forest surrounds a lone mountain,
that reaches into the heavens like a menacing claw. Evil seems to be concentrated there more than anywhere else…
