# Beginning

A strange force has been turning people into monsters, spreading like a disease. Our hero Kira is investigating what could possibly cause this terrific curse. 

Maybe the town blacksmith would know something about what is going on. 

While making her way to the blacksmiths forge, Kira encountered a townsfolk that looked ill. You walk over to them, and they whisper “I don’t feel so good”

First battle begins. Kira is still young and only knows how to swing her sword one way. 

You fight off the monster. 

After the battle you continue your journey towards the blacksmith.

You encounter more monsters on your way. You fight them of gaining more experience and learn a new attack.

You finally arrive to the towns blacksmith and ask him if he has any clue on what’s going on. He says that he heard some high pitched screech’s from the north near the forest border. He also informs you that he’s niece has been missing.

You start to journey north. 

Along the way you encounter a few more monsters. You fight them and continue.

As you approach the border of the forest you hear a scream!

You go investigate and find the blacksmiths niece getting attacked by a monster. You pull out your sword and begin to fight the monster. This one feel’s more powerful than your previous encounters. After a hard-fought victory, you save the niece. 

You gain more experience and learn a new attack.

You tell the niece to go home and continue your investigation through the forest.

You come across a wizard. He tells you that you are in over your head. He pulls out he’s staff and begins the fight.

After you emerge victorious you question the wizard about what is going on. He yells with his last breath, that the dark lord will bring forth hell to all mankind. He collapses and dies. 

After the fight you feel exhausted and decide to sleep to recuperate your health.
